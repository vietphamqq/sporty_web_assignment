# Parallel execution settings
# Use -n auto to auto-detect number of CPUs
# Or use -n 4 for explicit worker count
# Enable with: pytest -n auto or pytest -n 4

# Distribution strategy for parallel execution
# --dist worksteal: dynamic work distribution (recommended)
# --dist each: run each test on all workers
# --dist load: distribute by test count

# Markers
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    integration: marks tests as integration tests
    smoke: marks tests as smoke tests
    parallel: marks tests as safe for parallel execution
